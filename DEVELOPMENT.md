# Development Status

## Project Overview
Fountainflow is a Rust implementation of fountain codes based on RFC 5053 (Raptor Forward Error Correction). The project aims to provide high-performance file transfer capabilities using fountain codes for reliable data transmission over unreliable networks.

## Completed Features

### Core Implementation
- ✅ Basic fountain code encoder (src/fountain.rs)
  - Block generation with configurable size
  - RFC 5053 compliant degree distribution
  - Deterministic block generation based on sequence numbers
  - Input validation and error handling

- ✅ Raptor code decoder (src/decoder.rs)
  - Block collection and state management
  - Equation system construction
  - Gaussian elimination solver integration
  - RFC 5053 compliant decoding process

- ✅ Supporting Components
  - Binary matrix operations for solving equation systems (src/linear_algebra.rs)
  - Degree distribution generator (src/distribution.rs)
  - UDP transport layer (src/transport.rs)
  - CLI interface structure (src/cli.rs)

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for encoder functionality
  - Block creation
  - Parameter validation
  - Deterministic generation
- ✅ Unit tests for decoder functionality
  - Parameter validation
  - Block processing
  - Basic decoding verification

## Pending Development

### Core Features
- [ ] Systematic encoding support (partially implemented in src/systematic.rs)
- [ ] Intermediate block generation (RFC 5053 Section 5.4.2.3)
- [ ] LT encoding symbol generation (RFC 5053 Section 5.4.4)
- [ ] Complete LDPC and Half symbol handling in decoder

### Optimizations
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large files
- [ ] Memory usage optimizations for block storage
- [ ] Parallel processing support for encoding/decoding

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] End-to-end integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Stress testing with large files
- [ ] Network failure scenario testing

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Usage examples
- [ ] Performance guidelines
- [ ] Network configuration recommendations

## Current Focus
The current development focus is on:
1. Completing the systematic encoding support
2. Implementing remaining RFC 5053 encoding/decoding components
3. Adding comprehensive integration tests

## Notes
- The project follows RFC 5053 specifications for Raptor Forward Error Correction
- Current implementation supports block sizes that result in 4-256 source blocks
- Basic UDP transport is implemented but needs robustness improvements
